        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          In the CS-210 Programming Languages course, I created a C++ command
          line application designed to analyze text records of items purchased
          and provide the user with valuable insights. The three main features
          are searching for specific item frequency, generating a list of all
          items with their frequency, and creating a histogram of all the items.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          My enhancement for this category was to convert this program from a
          C++ command line application into a modern React JS web application
          using Material UI. This enhancement includes features that allow the
          user to input a text list that the application will then process and
          show the data in a searchable list or graph.
        </p>

          <strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Front-End Development, Error
          Handling, Data Visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Course Objectives:</strong> Professional-quality
          communications, Secure software solutions.

          My enhancement for this category was to enhance performance by
          utilizing powerful and well know sorting and searching algorithms to
          improve the applications performance. I implemented a merge sort
          combined with a binary search to quickly and reliably search through
          the user input data ensuring a smooth user experience.

          Originally this application just stored and read data from text files;
          my enhancement improves this application by using Google Firebase to
          store user data for user authentication along with their product data.
          This allows users to utilize this application from wherever they have
          internet access as their data will always be securely stored in the
          cloud.
