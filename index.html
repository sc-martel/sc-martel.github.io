        <h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          The artifact I selected for enhancement one is a C++ command-line
          application created in the CS-210 Programming Languages course during
          my first term at Southern New Hampshire University. The program is
          designed to analyze text records of items purchased, providing the
          user with insights such as the frequency of specific items, a list of
          all items with their frequency, and a histogram displaying the
          frequencies. This application reads an input text file and uses a map
          data structure to count and store the occurrences of each item.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          I chose this artifact because it demonstrates my foundational skills
          in software design and engineering, particularly in handling file
          input and output, data processing, and user interaction through a
          command-line interface. The specific components that highlight my
          skills include the implementation of file reading and writing, the use
          of maps for data storage, and the generation of visual representations
          of data through histograms. By converting this application to a modern
          web application using React JS and Material UI, I aimed to enhance my
          front-end development skills and create a more modern user-friendly
          and accessible interface.
        </p>
        <h3>With this enhancement, I have met these two course objectives:</h3>

      <!-- Enhancement Two -->
      <section class="enhancement">
        <h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          The artifact I chose for enhancement two is a command line text file
          processor application that analyzes text records of purchased items,
          providing insights such as item frequencies and visual
          representations. It was initially created during the CS-210
          Programming Languages course during my first year at Southern New
          Hampshire University.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to
          implement and optimize algorithms and data structures to create a
          seamless user experience. The components showcasing my skills include
          the implementation of merge sort for sorting the data and binary
          search for consistent and efficient data retrieval. The artifact was
          improved by replacing the original linear search with these more
          efficient algorithms, improving the search algorithm's time complexity
          from O (n) to O (log n).
        </p>
        <h3>
          With this enhancement, I have met the following course objectives:
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem
            using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and
            standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs
            involved in design choices.
          </strong>
          Implementing Merge Sort with a time complexity of O (n log n) and
          Binary Search with a time complexity of O (log n) highlights my
          ability to design efficient algorithms to handle large datasets. These
          algorithms provide optimal solutions for sorting and searching,
          balancing time complexity and performance, ensuring that the
          application runs efficiently even with large amounts of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative
            techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose
            of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish

          </strong>
          By optimizing the search functionality through efficient algorithms,
          the application runs significantly faster, enhancing the user
          experience. The application previously used a linear search which has
          a time complexity of O (n), so the binary search with a time
          complexity of O (log n) gives a significant performance increase. This
          optimization also conserves resources, demonstrating my ability to
          implement solutions that deliver value and meet industry standards.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          Enhancing this artifact for milestone three showed me the value of
          algorithm efficiency and how data structures impact performance. One
          of the challenges was ensuring that the merge sort and binary search
          were properly created and integrated into the existing program without
          breaking the existing functionality. This process helped me improve my
          problem-solving abilities and attention to detail in software
          development.

      <!-- Enhancement Three -->
      <section class="enhancement">
        <h2>Databases</h2>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          The C++ command-line application I used for enhancement three was
          developed in the CS-210 Programming Languages course during my first
          term at Southern New Hampshire University. The application is designed
          for analyzing text records of purchased goods, presenting the user
          with information such as the frequency of certain items, a list of all
          items and their frequencies, and a histogram depicting the
          frequencies. This application reads a text file and utilizes a map
          data structure to count and save the number of times each item
          appears.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          This artifact was chosen for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my
          ability to integrate cloud-based services into an application. I
          converted the application from a standalone application to one that
          allows user accounts and permanent data storage by integrating
          Firebase Authentication for user login and Firestore for data storage.
          This upgrade demonstrates my ability to deal with real-time databases
          and authentication systems in complying with modern software
          development techniques. I enabled secure management of Firebase
          configuration via environment variables and modified the program to
          update current item data in the database rather than duplicate
          entries.
        </p>
        <h3>With this enhancement, I have met these two course objectives:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that
            enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making
            in the field of computer science.
          </strong>

          data-driven decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in
            software architecture and designs to expose potential
            vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and
            enhanced security of data and resources.
          </strong>
          By implementing secure user authentication and data management
          practices I ensure that user data is protected against unauthorized
          access and potential vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          One of the most difficult issues I had was ensuring that the data
          stored in Firestore was properly updated without duplicate entries.
          This required a methodical approach to database operations, with
          emphasis on data consistency and accuracy. I also had to deal with the
          complexity of integrating Firebase into the existing application
          design, ensuring that the user interface and experience retained the
          existing functionality. This experience helped me enhance my
          problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of thorough
          testing and debugging to ensure reliable application performance.
